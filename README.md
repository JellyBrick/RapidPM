# _RapidPM_

_**High performance extension**_ that implements parts of **[PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)** with **[Zephir](https://www.zephir-lang.com)**.

## Why should I use [RapidPM](https://github.com/organization/RapidPM)?

The most popular game server application for _"Minecraft: Bedrock Edition"_: **[PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)** is written in **[PHP](https://github.com/php/php-src)**.

_PocketMine-MP_ requires massive computation resources by nature of the game server, however PHP is the major cause of slow-down issue.

The **only way** to fix this issue is to eradicating the rotten root: **replacing PHP into high performance language**.

_**RapidPM**_ will do this for you.

## Why use [Zephir](https://www.zephir-lang.com)?

**[PHP](https://github.com/php/php-src)**'s C extension API is **very difficult to handle** and **memory-unsafe**.

Our resolution to address this issue is writing with **[Zephir](https://www.zephir-lang.com)**, **memory-safe** and **intuitive** language.
